        Conrad Weise is a Cologne/Cluj based artist and researcher. In his work he looks at socio-political settings where he locates computation and its implications. Through investigative and computational approaches from within these systems, his works attempt to contextualise the intransparent and uncertain arrangements. His current research focuses in particular on the hidden labour and automated engagement within computational systems.

        <p>Reflects on the hidden labour within computational systems and locates the simulated engagement of group control systems within surveillance capitalism as a subversion to it. This work finds great inspiration within the field of digital anthropology and takes a cultural approach: it treats the lived experiences of people involved in the production of automated engagement and group control systems as the subject for theorising the complicated structures of contemporary digital capital.

        <p>Looks at the concept of work and employment in the age of the internet with focusing on the growing entanglement of entrepreneurialism and new shapes of the precariat. Through analyzing the phenomenon of group control systems within the discourse of interface cultures a specific type of engagement towards work becomes visible.

        <h2>Translation of Computation</h2>
        <img src="assets/translation.png">
        <p>Since the beginning of computation it’s physicality has become increasingly smaller and since Gordon Moore’s
          famous prediction computation became almost transparent. In today's information age, it is easy to forget about
          the socio-political presence of software, when algorithms are used by the local police to predict where next
          crimes will happen, huge logistic warehouses are organized by the machine’s preferences and hype technologies
          consume more electricity than entire countries. <br> While these computational systems are often camouflaged as
          being objective or neutral, the underlying processes are anything but. At the core software development is about
          the interpretation of inclusion and exclusion. <br> This work looks at the origin and manifestation of
          computation and how it is reinforcing highly rational ways of thinking, which do not integrate into the complex
          world around us. ↬ <a href="works/translation.pdf">translation.pdf</a> <a href="https://github.com/cccccccccccccccccnrd/translation-of-computation">translation-of-computation.git</a></p>

        <h2>Topology of Computation</h2>
        <img src="assets/topology.png">
        <p>Since the beginning of computation it’s physicality has become increasingly smaller and since Gordon Moore’s
          famous prediction computation became almost transparent. In today's information age, it is easy to forget about
          the physical presence of software, when user interfaces blend completely into their environment, fiber-optic
          cables lay deep in the pacific, and almost everything is stored in the cloud. <br> For now the incomprehensible
          world of computation was reduced to the inner workings of integrated circuits or machines. But with spaces like
          Amazon fulfillment centers its rationality and opaqueness is mapped onto our physical space. <br> This work
          places computation in the center of the architectural and spatial discourse and explores how computation is
          actively structuring physical and relational space. ↬ <a href="works/topology.pdf">topology.pdf</a></p>
