      <p>Performes a standard Turing test via establishing a conversation with the exhibition visitor and an Amazon mechanical turk worker—creating a connection between the fauxtomation and socio-political implications of machine learning.

      <img src="assets/translation.png">
      <p>Since the beginning of computation it’s physicality has become increasingly smaller and since Gordon Moore’s
        famous prediction computation became almost transparent. In today's information age, it is easy to forget about
        the socio-political presence of software, when algorithms are used by the local police to predict where next
        crimes will happen, huge logistic warehouses are organized by the machine’s preferences and hype technologies
        consume more electricity than entire countries. <br> While these computational systems are often camouflaged as
        being objective or neutral, the underlying processes are anything but. At the core software development is about
        the interpretation of inclusion and exclusion. <br> This work looks at the origin and manifestation of
        computation and how it is reinforcing highly rational ways of thinking, which do not integrate into the complex
        world around us. ↬ <a href="works/translation.pdf">translation.pdf</a> <a href="https://github.com/cccccccccccccccccnrd/translation-of-computation">translation-of-computation.git</a></p>

      <img src="assets/topology.png">
      <p>Since the beginning of computation it’s physicality has become increasingly smaller and since Gordon Moore’s
        famous prediction computation became almost transparent. In today's information age, it is easy to forget about
        the physical presence of software, when user interfaces blend completely into their environment, fiber-optic
        cables lay deep in the pacific, and almost everything is stored in the cloud. <br> For now the incomprehensible
        world of computation was reduced to the inner workings of integrated circuits or machines. But with spaces like
        Amazon fulfillment centers its rationality and opaqueness is mapped onto our physical space. <br> This work
        places computation in the center of the architectural and spatial discourse and explores how computation is
        actively structuring physical and relational space. ↬ <a href="works/topology.pdf">topology.pdf</a></p>
