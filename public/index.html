      <p>Since the beginning of computation it’s physicality has become increasingly smaller and since Gordon Moore’s famous prediction computation became almost transparent. In today's information age, it is easy to forget about the socio-political presence of software, when algorithms are used by the local police to predict where next crimes will happen, huge logistic warehouses are organized by the machine’s preferences and hype technologies consume more electricity than entire countries. <br> While these computational systems are often camouflaged as being objective or neutral, the underlying processes are anything but. At the core software development is about the interpretation of inclusion and exclusion. <br> This work looks at the origin and manifestation of computation and how it is reinforcing highly rational ways of thinking, which do not integrate into the complex world around us. <a href="works/translation.pdf">translation.pdf</a></p>

      <p>Since the beginning of computation it’s physicality has become increasingly smaller and since Gordon Moore’s famous prediction computation became almost transparent. In today's information age, it is easy to forget about the physical presence of software, when user interfaces blend completely into their environment, fiber-optic cables lay deep in the pacific, and almost everything is stored in the cloud. <br> For now the incomprehensible world of computation was reduced to the inner workings of integrated circuits or machines. But with spaces like Amazon fulfillment centers its rationality and opaqueness is mapped onto our physical space. <br> This work places computation in the center of the architectural and spatial discourse and explores how computation is actively structuring physical and relational space. <a href="works/topology.pdf">topology.pdf</a></p>
